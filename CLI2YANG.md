# CLI2YANG
CLI to YANG is an IOS XE feature that converts currently configured features to either XML to use with NETCONF or JSON to use with RESTCONF.

## Retrieve running config on the device in CLI
Review the CLI running configuration

1. Review the running configuration in the good ole fashioned CLI using `show run`


## Retrieve running config formatted in XML for NETCONF
Generate the XML of the current running config using `netconf-xml`

## Retrieve run config formatted with JSON for RESTCONF
Generate the JSON of the current running config using  `restconf-json`

## Update the running-config with a script
Update the config

1. `[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ netconf-format > config.before` (this will take a few seconds to complete).
2. Escape from the c9300 using `[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ exit`.
3. Escape from the c9300 using `c9300# exit`.
4. Run the script by running the command `auto@pod5-xelab:~$ cd ~/cli2yang ; ./update-config.sh`.
5. What is the printed flag (a hashed string) when updating the configuration through the script above?

## Compare differences in the config
How many lines of config have changed after running `./cli2yang/update-config.sh`?

1. Run the following commands from the Guest Shell prompt.
  If you are not already connected to the switch, then connect with: `telnet c9300`.
  Then enter the Guest Shell from the C9300 prompt with: `guestshell`.
  
  ```
  [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ netconf-format > config.after (this will take a few seconds to complete)
  [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ diff config.before config.after | wc -l  (Use diff again while using line count tool)
  ```

## Review the config that changed
Run the following to see the changes in the config:
```
[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ diff config.before config.after
```
There is a short amount of output and the final line is the flag, including the open and closing brackets `<` and `>`.

1. Determine which feature was added by running `[guestshell@guestshell ~]$ diff config.before config.after`.

## Which IOS feature did the script add?
After running the `update-config.sh` script, notice the new config that was added. What is the feature found using 
the `GET` method? Note: `update-config.sh` applies the changes in `terraform.tf`.
